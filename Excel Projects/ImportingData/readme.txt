One of the key skills demonstrated in this project is the ability to import and clean data from various sources. The project required me to gather financial information from a range of sources and then use Excel tools and techniques to organize and prepare the data for analysis. This included tasks such as merging data from multiple sources, handling missing or incomplete data, and standardizing data formats. By successfully completing these tasks, I was able to ensure that the data was accurate and reliable, which was crucial for the subsequent analysis.
