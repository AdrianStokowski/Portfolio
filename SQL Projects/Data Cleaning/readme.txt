 I used SQL in my project to perform data cleaning tasks. I was able to efficiently identify and fix issues in my datasets, such as missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies. I also had the ability to perform data transformations, such as merging and splitting columns, and validate the quality of my data. With this project, I was able to ensure that my data was clean and ready for further analysis and visualization.
