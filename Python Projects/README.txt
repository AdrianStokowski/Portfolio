This file covers simplest form of Machine Learning to predict stock prices (or rather returns) in Python using a Linear Regression.

You should not take this as a valid trading strategy. It is just an idea how a linear Regression can be used and how overfitting can be avoided or at least diminished using a train test split.

I am purposely NOT showing a time horizon where this is working or looking nicely to make you aware of that.
