I focused on honing my knowledge of Python, decision and repetition statements, data structures, Pandas, Matplotlib, SciPy statistics, gmaps, and the Application Programming Interface (API) concepts during this project. It was a great opportunity for me to improve my skills in these areas, and I feel more confident in my ability to use Python and these related tools and techniques for future programming projects.
