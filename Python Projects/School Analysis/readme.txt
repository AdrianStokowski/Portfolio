During this project, I was introduced to the powerful pandas package, which is integrated in the python-conda environment. I learned how to use many of its useful functions for efficient data analytics and visualization. I was impressed by the capabilities of pandas and how it can streamline data analysis tasks in Python. I am now more confident in my ability to use pandas to manipulate and visualize data in my future projects.
