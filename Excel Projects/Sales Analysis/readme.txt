This Excel project involved a deep dive into the sales data of a US super store, using a range of Excel tools and techniques to extract meaningful insights that could help the management team make crucial decisions to expand their business and establish a strong market presence globally. In addition to performing data analysis, I also utilized my skills in Excel dashboard building to create interactive visualizations that made it easy for the management team to quickly understand and act on the insights. Overall, the project demonstrated my ability to use Excel to effectively analyze and communicate complex data, and I am confident that the insights I uncovered will help the company make informed business decisions.
