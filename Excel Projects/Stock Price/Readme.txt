In this Excel project, I analyzed stock prices using a combination of Excel functions and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code. I started by importing historical stock price data into a worksheet, then used a variety of Excel tools such as pivot tables and charts to visualize and analyze the data. I also used VBA to automate certain tasks and perform more advanced analysis on the data. Some examples of analyses I conducted included identifying trends and patterns in the stock price data, calculating financial metrics such as return on investment, and creating buy and sell recommendations based on my analysis. Overall, this project provided a hands-on opportunity for me to apply my Excel and VBA skills to real-world financial data and gain a deeper understanding of the stock market.
