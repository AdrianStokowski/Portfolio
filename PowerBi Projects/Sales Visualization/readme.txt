 I used Power BI in my project to visualize sales data. I was able to connect to various data sources, including databases and spreadsheets, and easily import and transform my data. With this project, I was able to create interactive dashboards and reports that displayed my sales data in a clear and visually appealing way. I had the ability to customize my visualizations and add interactivity, such as filters and drill-downs, to allow for deeper analysis of my data.
