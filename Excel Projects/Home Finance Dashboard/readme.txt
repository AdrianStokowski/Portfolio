I developed this Excel project with the goal of tracking my expenses and gaining a complete financial picture, which would enable me to make informed and smart money decisions. The project allowed me to demonstrate and hone my Excel skills by importing, organizing, and analyzing financial data, creating pivot tables and charts to visualize the data, and using VBA to automate tasks and perform advanced analysis.
