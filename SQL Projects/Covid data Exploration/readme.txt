I used SQL in my project to analyze COVID-19 case data. I was able to retrieve and manipulate data from various sources, including government health agencies and research organizations. With this project, I was able to generate insights on the spread of the virus, such as the number of cases and deaths by location and time period. I also had the ability to perform trend analysis and make predictions on the future trajectory of the pandemic.
